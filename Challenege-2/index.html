        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello world! I am a 21 year old web developer. I started out in the work force right after high school but, I soon found I wasn't happy with the work force. I took some time and did research on different careers when I found web development. I already have a great passion for gaming and spent lots of time on the web so this career path was the perfect fit! I took the initiative and enrolled into an EdEX bootcamp at UCF and now here I am!</p>
